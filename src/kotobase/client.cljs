(ns kotobase.client
  "Promise-based ClojureScript client for the kotobase.net tenant Datom plane
  (`ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.*`). Runs in both the browser SPA and the
  cljs Workers (workerd/node) — global `fetch` + Web Crypto are present in both.

  Reads (`q`/`datoms`/`pull`) mint a read CACAO by default (the operator
  yoro-social db is private); pass `:public? true` to skip auth when the graph
  is registered Public. Writes (`transact`) mint a write CACAO. The single
  client identity IS the operator Ed25519 key, so `canonical-graph` resolves
  the operator's own `kotobase/db/<operator-did>/<db-name>` (the only writable
  namespace).

  ── CACAO auth profiles (`make-client` `:auth-profile`) ─────────────────────
  The kotobase.net APEX (net-kotobase clj-edge, cf-wasm cutover 2026-07-08)
  gates every datomic.* call on a CACAO that (validate-cacao, live-probed
  2026-07-09):
    1. carries the `kotoba://can/kotobase:pin` capability,
    2. carries a `kotoba://graph/` scope equal to the ISSUER DID (a graph-CID
       scope without the issuer DID is REJECTED — \"CACAO graph scope does
       not include issuer DID\"),
    3. arrives with an `x-kotoba-did` header matching the issuer, and
    4. uses a FRESH nonce per request (the edge records nonces in B2 for
       replay protection — reusing one 401s).
  This ns's pre-cutover mint (operation capability + graph-CID scope) fails
  checks 1–2, so every stock caller was getting
  `401 {\"ok\":false,\"error\":\"Unauthorized\"}` against the apex.

  `:auth-profile :apex` (the DEFAULT) mints the edge shape: primary capability
  `kotobase:pin`, the operation capabilities (`datom:read` /
  `datom:transact`+`tx:create`) riding along as extras, graph scope = issuer
  DID — the same shape yoro-ui.studio.genko-store proved live against the
  apex (app-aozora ab21923, 2026-07-09). Request addressing is unchanged: the
  body still names the canonical graph CID; only the CACAO scope moved. Every
  mint (including each retry attempt) gets a fresh nonce.

  `:auth-profile :legacy` keeps the pre-cutover byte shape (operation
  capability primary, `kotoba://graph/<graph-cid>` scope, no kotobase:pin)
  for endpoints that still verify it — e.g. a pod/tenant-worker lineage that
  pre-dates the apex edge. Same fn signatures either way; the profile only
  changes the minted CACAO.

  ── direct transport (`make-client` `:transport :direct-v1`) ────────────────
  Default `:transport` is `:xrpc` (everything above this paragraph — POSTs
  `/xrpc/ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.<method>`, JSON envelope, apex/legacy
  CACAO). `:direct-v1` instead talks straight to a `kotoba-lang/
  kotobase-storage-d1` deployment's own native surface (`/v1/transact` /
  `/v1/q` / `/v1/pull` / `/v1/datoms` / `/v1/fold` / `/v1/view`) — no XRPC
  edge in the path at all. Same six fn signatures either way; only the wire
  shape and the RESPONSE SHAPE change:

  * ref addressing: XRPC keys reads/writes by a content-addressed `graph`
    CID; direct-v1 sends the LITERAL `kotobase/db/<did>/<db-name>` string in
    an `x-kotobase-ref` header (storage-d1's own `authorize()` derives the
    tenant purely from the ref prefix + the CACAO issuer, ADR-2607260940).
  * CACAO capability: storage-d1's own gate checks for the literal resource
    `kotoba://can/datom:transact` (writes) / `kotoba://can/graph:query`
    (reads) — DIFFERENT strings from the XRPC vocabulary's `datom:read`/
    `datom:transact`+`tx:create` — and has no `kotobase:pin` concept and NO
    anonymous/public-read path (every direct-v1 call needs a `:secret-key`
    client; `:public-reads?` is XRPC-only).
  * body/response: raw `application/edn`, not a JSON envelope — direct-v1
    responses are `kotobase.datomic`'s OWN native shapes, not the XRPC
    handler's (kotobase-server's `do-transact`/`do-fold`/etc. are a SEPARATE
    implementation with different field names — e.g. `transact` returns
    `{:db-before :db-after :tx-data :tempids :novelty-size}`, not XRPC's
    `{:commit :datom_count :novelty_size}`). `datoms`/`view` happen to share
    the `{:e :a :v_edn :added}` row shape either transport uses, so those two
    are wrapped to the SAME `.-datoms`/`.-rows` JS shape callers already
    read; `transact`/`fold`/`pull`/`q` are NOT byte-compatible with XRPC —
    read this ns's `v1-*` fn docstrings for their exact native shape before
    depending on a field."

  "Why every XRPC read body now carries `db_name` beside `graph`.

  The apex used to resolve a read from the content-addressed `graph` CID
  alone. Since ADR-2607279500 it bridges `datomic.*` to
  kotobase-storage-d1, which addresses refs as the literal string
  `kotobase/db/<did>/<name>` and cannot invert a CID back into one. A read
  carrying only the CID therefore answers 404 `UnknownGraphCid` — and this
  client's own `empty-on-404` then turns that into an EMPTY RESULT, which is
  indistinguishable from an empty database. That is how every
  cloud-itonami-marketplace-* actor came back with zero rows against a store
  that had data.

  Measured against kotobase.net on 2026-07-28, same CACAO, four bodies:

    literal ref, no db_name   200
    literal ref + db_name     200
    CID graph, no db_name     404 UnknownGraphCid
    CID graph + db_name       200

  `transact` already sent `db_name`, which is why writes probed clean while
  reads did not. Sending both keeps the CID addressing the pod understands
  and gives the bridge the name it needs — neither side is guessed at."

  (\"Datalog query (EDN string)\"), which was true for one transport and

  Rows come back `{s p o}` from the apex — the same positions as a
  datom's `{e a v}`. Under :direct-v1 the response is reshaped to
  `.-rows_edn` for a :relation-shaped query only — see `v1-q-response`.
