(ns kotobase.blocks
  "CID-verified block reads over `GET /ipld/<cid>` — the transport a client
  uses when the server is only a byte store.

  ## Why this exists

  Every other read in this library is an RPC: `kotobase.client/q` POSTs
  `/xrpc/ai.gftd.apps.kotobase.datomic.q` and the Worker executes the query
  inside its own CPU budget. `kotobase.datom-source` moved the *algebra* to
  the caller but still reads through `datomic.datoms`, so the index descent
  and the novelty merge stay on the server.

  This namespace is the rung below both: the server hands back immutable
  bytes named by their own hash, and the caller does the rest. The route it
  speaks to states the same split — *\"Reads are public and verified by CID\"*
  (`kotobase-graph-database`'s `handle-ipld-block`) — and serves them
  `cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`, which is only sound
  because the name IS the content.

  ## The verification is the point, and it happens HERE

  \"Verified by CID\" is a claim about what the origin stores, not about what
  arrived. A cache, a proxy, a compromised bucket, or a bit flip all produce
  bytes that the origin's own check never saw. So this namespace re-derives
  the address from the bytes it actually received and **refuses** anything
  that does not match. `get-block` never returns unverified bytes:

  | outcome                          | result                             |
  |----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | 200 and digest matches           | `Uint8Array`                       |
  | 404                              | `nil` — absent, not an error       |
  | 200 and digest does NOT match    | rejects `:kotobase.blocks/corrupt` |
  | CID this code cannot hash-check  | rejects `:unsupported-multihash`   |
  | any other status                 | rejects `:kotobase.blocks/http`    |

  The fourth row is deliberate. A multihash we cannot recompute (anything but
  sha2-256) leaves us unable to *answer*, and an unanswerable check must not
  return the same value as a check that passed — so it refuses rather than
  handing back bytes it did not verify. Superproject CLAUDE.md calls this
  class out by name: an inspection that could not run must not look like an
  inspection that found nothing wrong.

  ## Scope, and where the credential is NOT

  Reading needs no credential at all, which is what makes this usable from a
  page that holds no key. Contributing a block does — `PUT /ipld/<cid>`
  requires a CACAO carrying `kotoba://can/kotobase:pin` — but this namespace
  still holds none: `put-block!` takes an already-minted `Authorization`
  value from its caller. Minting lives in `kotobase.cacao`, so a reader can
  see at a glance that nothing here can sign anything.

  The write exists because a client that can only read cannot publish the
  index it computed. Superproject ADR-2608085000 is about exactly that
  boundary: the client does the work, and what it may write back is bytes
  named by their own hash — which no amount of malice can turn into somebody
  else's block."
