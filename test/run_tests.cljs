(ns run-tests
  "The portable half of this suite, for a runtime that is not shadow-cljs.

      npx nbb --classpath src:test:<datom-source>/src:<org-nist-sha2>/src \\
        test/run_tests.cljs

  `npm test` remains the full suite. This entry exists so a fleet node can
  run one — `:nbb-test` is what the node has, and until now nothing outside a
  developer's terminal ran any of this.

  ## Why seven namespaces and not nine

  Two suites measure the runtime rather than the library under nbb, so they
  are excluded by name instead of being left to fail:

  - `kotobase.client-request-test` (8 failures, 1 error)
  - `kotobase.client-auth-profile-test` (1 failure)

  Both come from one difference, measured 2026-09-06: **SCI wraps a `throw`
  raised inside a `.then` callback** — `ex-data` becomes
  `{:type :sci/error …}` and the original moves to `ex-cause`. The retry path
  in `kotobase.client` inspects the error to decide whether a 5xx is
  transient, so under nbb it does not retry. That is a real difference and it
  is written down here rather than papered over; it is not a production
  defect, because nothing runs `kotobase.client` under nbb — it is a browser
  and Worker library.

  `kotobase.blocks-test` reads the type through `blocks-test/error-type`,
  which unwraps the SCI layer, so it holds on both runtimes. The rest never
  throw inside a `.then`.

  ## Both runtimes, same numbers

  These seven were 55 tests / 163 assertions under nbb and the same under
  `shadow-cljs :node-test` when this was written. Agreement across two
  runtimes is the point of running it twice; a gate that only reproduces
  shadow-cljs would tell you nothing shadow-cljs did not."
