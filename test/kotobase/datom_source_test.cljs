  "The claim under test is the PLAN: that every pattern shape the conformance
  corpus exercises is pushed to an index read that actually returns the datoms
  that pattern needs.

  So the fake `datoms-fn` here is deliberately strict — it serves the corpus
  the way `kotobase-server`'s `do-datoms` does, honouring `index` and
  `components` exactly. A plan that names the wrong index, or puts components
  in the wrong order, returns the wrong rows and the conformance suite catches
  it. A permissive fake that ignored its arguments would prove nothing."
